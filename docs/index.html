        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>This project simulates cloth as it is affected by various forces like gravity and itself. I learned quite a lot 
        from this project. Seeing the principles discussed during lecture be applied has been really informative. I was really
        impressed at how effective a point mass and spring system can simulate cloth.</p>

        <h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and springs</h2>
        <p>
            The implementation of part 1 involves creating masses with a nested for loop that iterates num_height_points * num_width_points times.
            In each iteration a mass is created in it's respective position in the 2-D cloth space. The spacing for each point mass
            is determined by dividing the width by the number of width points, and dividing the height by the number of height points.
            The orientation of the cloth determined the position of either the y value or the z value. After the point masses were created,
            the springs were next. By iterating through the point_masses vector and checking for specific conditions, we can assign springs to
            point masses. Determining these conditions are done by calculating if there are point masses available to be attached to from the current
            pont mass.

        <h2 align="middle">Part II: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
        <p>
            Simulating cloth is done by first summing all external accelerations and dividing that by the mass to get a total external force vector.
            Iterating through each point mass, we reset the force vector for that point mass, and then add the total external force vector to the
            point mass' force vector. The Springs have an effect on the force vector of the point mass, and so we need to factor them in. Iterating
            through the springs, we calculate the spring forces using Hooke's law and apply it it the unit direction vector between the two point masses
            of each spring. This scaled unit vector is then added to one mass and subtracted from the opposite.
        </p>

        <p>
            The actual integration is done by iterating through each point mass and applying the Verlet integration formula to calculate the next position
            of each mass.  Applying a spring stretch constraint to prevent a deformation of over 1.1 times the resting spring length is done by
            calculating the actual length of the spring, and then taking the difference between it and the max deformation length allowed.
            The positions of the point masses attached to the spring is moved by half of this difference, which is done by adding/subtracting the
            direction vector scaled by half of the difference. If both point masses are unpinned, then each mass gets moved, else only the unpinned mass
            gets moved at the full difference length.
        </p>

        <p>
            Running the simulation with a small spring constant results in a cloth sagging greater from the pinned points.
            Conversly a high spring constant results in the cloth being stiffer and not sagging very much, if at all.
            Increased density has an effect similar to decreasing the spring constant, and vice versa.
            Increasing the damping slows the rate of change of the cloth.

        <h2 align="middle">Part III: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
        <p>
            The difference between the cloth with default values resting on the sphere and the cloth with low ks
            is the low ks has the cloth sagging further. Contrast this with the high ks, which gives the cloth a stiffer look.
            It hangs further over the sphere in a tent like way.

        <h2 align="middle">Part IV: Handling self-collisions</h2>
        <p>
            A spatial map is created to partition all point masses into a corresponding spatial box. All points in the same
            spatial box are tested to see if they will self collide. If they will collide, then a correction vector is created
            to correct their position. This is done at each time step.
